This project is inspired by [terway](https://github.com/AliyunContainerService/terway), Thanks for the great works üëç.

## How to use it

You can use `kubectl` or `helm` install it. For example, refer to the following command:

Kubectl:

```shell
kubectl apply manifests/cilium-chaining.yaml -n kube-system
```

Helm:

```shell
helm install cilium-chaining charts/cilium-chaining -n kube-system
```

Note:

* You need to make sure that your node's kernel version is at least greater than **_4.19_**.
* Your cluster should be an _**underlay**_ cluster, and do **_not install_** cilium.

You will see cilium-chaining pod is running in your cluster:

```shell
kubectl get po -n kube-system 
```
